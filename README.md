### Centos 7
`docker pull quay.io/lest/centos7-rpm-build`

# Contributing

Please feel free to open a PR against the staging branch and open issues for any problems.
There is an issue where you have to re-chown files after running `make test`. This is something to do with user IDs when Docker is using a mounted volume. This has been partially resolved and now they are re-chowned after the build process.
